Cert_Collisions2022_355100_362760_Golden.json is the 2022 Run3 golden json that was divided up to eras (2022_runB.json, 2022_runC.json...)
for integrated luminosity calculations(brilcalc). The lumicorr files follow this correction:
'Due to a TCDS malfunction on Sep 29-30, no luminosity measurement is currently available for parts of runs 359571 and 359661. [â€¦] we
recommend to exclude these periods from analyses, to ensure that a proper integrated luminosity estimate is available.'
